    NOTEs:
    - Since we don't simulate the bluetooth feature during the process that finds neighbors,
    we assume that if the Open Location Code, between two or more users, is the same, then the 
    distance is very small. To assume that, we'll have to use the default OLC precision of 10 digits
    which consist in a range of 14m.
    We are aware that users in two different squares can be close althought the OLC is different, however we
    don't simulate that.
